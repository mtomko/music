## misek-sonata2
A reworking of Adolf Míšek's Sonata no. 2 in e minor for double bass. 
The commonly available part used bass clef and *8va* notation extensively, which is an unusual choice and can obscure octave jumps or confuse the shape of lines.
This version uses treble clef where logical to do so instead. It does not use tenor clef, as modern bass players tend to be comfortable with both bass and treble; tenor clef adds complexity while saving only a few ledger lines in the best case.
Currently this version includes the solo part in d minor only, on the assumption that the performer will use solo tuning. 
Eventually, I hope to make a clean copy of the piano score as well, with the solo part represented in e minor.
Doing so will probably make providing an e minor version possible as well, although this was probably not what the composer intended and could well be quite awkward for the performer.
